## 1. Project Overview
The project aims to build a simplified version of **Finn.no**, a marketplace for buying and selling items. The solution will be developed from scratch, hosted on a Raspberry Pi, and made accessible to users over a network. The project will demonstrate my skills in programming, setting up infrastructure, and providing user support. 

[**All code will be hosted on GitHub**](https://github.com/HenrikHaalandDev/VG2-Term-Project-NetThrifty), as required.

---

## 2. Concept Summary

There will be two types of users:

- **Seller**: Uploads product details (e.g., description, price) that are stored in a database.
- **Buyer**: Retrieves products from the database, adds them to a shopping cart, and views their items.

The solution will focus on basic functionality, security, and ease of use.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Infrastructure
- A **web server** hosted on a Raspberry Pi.
- **SQL database** to store and retrieve product and user data.
- A **network** setup to make the solution accessible to other users.

### 3.2 Code
- Self-developed code for both the **front-end** and **back-end**.
- Use of **basic data structures** (e.g., lists, dictionaries) to manage user data.
- **Error handling** and troubleshooting solutions during development.

### 3.3 Backup & Security
- A backup routine to ensure data safety.
- Security features such as user authentication and basic encryption.

### 3.4 User Support
- Clear **documentation** and **tutorials** to guide users on how to interact with the system.

---

## 4. Technologies

- **Back-end**: Python, SQL (database), Raspberry Pi (server)
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS (optional JavaScript)
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code storage and version management
- **Infrastructure**: Web server, network setup (e.g., local network or VPN)
- **Security**: Basic security measures to protect user data

---

## 5. Plan and Documentation

### 5.1 Planning and Design
- Initial project outline and network diagram.
- Design decisions (e.g., choice of database, server setup).

### 5.2 Implementation
- Step-by-step code explanation.
- Infrastructure setup (server, network).

### 5.3 Testing
- Testing scenarios to ensure the system works as expected.
- Adjustments based on testing feedback.

### 5.4 Backup and Security
- Backup routine documentation.
- Details of security measures and how they comply with relevant laws and regulations.

### 5.5 Training Materials
- User guide and technical documentation, tailored for end-users and technical reviewers.

## 6. What I'll Learn

- **Setting up infrastructure**: Creating and managing a server and network.
- **Database management**: Storing and retrieving data in a database.
- **Good file structure**:Separates code, documentation, and backups, making navigation and collaboration straightforward.
- **Programming**: Writing code that handles both back-end and front-end operations.
- **Backup routines**: Implementing backup systems to protect data.
- **Security**: Ensuring the system complies with security best practices and regulations.
- **User support**: Creating tutorials and offering user support for the solution.
- **Troubleshooting**: Solving issues that arise during development.
- **Flask**: Learning its ability to do templating with jinja.
