## Week 42 

### Daily Breakdown

#### 10/14/2024
- **Activities/Notes:**
  - I have decided on what I will be creating for this semester. I will be creating a Online Shop. A Finn 2.0 
  - Ive written a ["Planning"](../docs/Part1%20Planning.md). Check it out to get more detailes.
  - Ive made all the folders I will need for this project (I think). Same with some files. Ive created most of the front-end files such as `HTML`, `CSS` & `JavaScript`.
  - I have looked at some websites such as 
  [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/nb-no/), 
  [Bose](https://www.bose.com/home), 
  [Dell](https://www.dell.com/no-no), 
  [Razer](https://www.razer.com/), 
  [SONY](https://www.sony.com/en/), 
  [ONEPLUS](https://www.oneplus.com/no) & 
  [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/sale)
    - The one I thought fits my style and idea is [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/sale).
  - Although, I will use minimal css, my website will only be created to be functional and not styled.
#### 10/15/2024
- **Activities/Notes:**
  - I've learned a lot about file and folder structure. Now it's much easier for me to navigate, both for myself and for potential future collaborators.
  - I need to think about what I want to add in the database. 
  - I need to figure out how I can chop up this big project in smaller bits, and figure out what I will work on.

#### 10/16/2024
- **Activities/Notes:**
  - Ive done a lot of research at home. I will be ish starting from scratch cause most of the code I wrote wasnt mine either way. Didnt understand half of it. But this time Im lock and loaded.
